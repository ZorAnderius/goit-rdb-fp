1) For each unique combination of Entity and Code or their id, 
calculate the average, minimum, maximum value and sum for 
the Number_rabies attribute.

use pandemic;

SELECT  c.country_name,
		c.country_code,
        AVG(i.Number_rabies) as average_number_rabies,
        MIN(i.Number_rabies) as min_number_rabies,
        SUM(i.Number_rabies) as sum_number_rabies
FROM infectious_cases AS i
JOIN countries AS c ON c.id=i.country_id
WHERE Number_rabies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.country_name, c.country_code;

2) Sort the result by the calculated average in descending order.

use pandemic;

SELECT  c.country_name,
		c.country_code,
	   AVG(i.Number_rabies) as average_number_rabies,
       MIN(i.Number_rabies) as min_number_rabies,
       SUM(i.Number_rabies) as sum_number_rabies
FROM infectious_cases AS i
JOIN countries AS c ON c.id=i.country_id
WHERE Number_rabies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.country_name, c.country_code
ORDER BY average_number_rabies DESC;



3) Select only 10 lines to display.

use pandemic;

SELECT  c.country_name,
		c.country_code,
	   AVG(i.Number_rabies) as average_number_rabies,
       MIN(i.Number_rabies) as min_number_rabies,
       SUM(i.Number_rabies) as sum_number_rabies
FROM infectious_cases AS i
JOIN countries AS c ON c.id=i.country_id
WHERE Number_rabies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY c.country_name, c.country_code
ORDER BY average_number_rabies DESC
LIMIT 10;
