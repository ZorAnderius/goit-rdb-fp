## Task1

Download data:

 - *Create the pandemic schema in the database using the SQL command.*
 - *Select it as the default schema using the SQL command.*
 - *Import the data using the Import wizard as you did in topic 3.*
 - *Look at the data for context.*



## Task2

Normalize the infectious_cases table to 3rd normal form. Save two tables with normalized data in the same schema.


## Task3

Analyze the data:

 For each unique combination of Entity and Code or their id, calculate the average, minimum, maximum value and sum for the Number_rabies attribute.
 
 
 - *Sort the result by the calculated average in descending order.*
 - *Select only 10 lines to display.*


 ## Task4

Construct a column of the difference in years.

For the original or normalized table for the Year column, build using the built-in SQL functions:

 - *an attribute that creates the date of January 1 of the corresponding year,*
 - *attribute equal to the current date,*
 - *attribute equal to the difference in years of the two columns mentioned above.*


 ## Task5

Build your own function.

 Create and use a function that constructs the same attribute as in the previous task: the function should take as input a year value and return the difference in years between the current date and the date created from the year attribute (year 1996 â†’ '1996-01-01 ').
